__Random Background__ is an Eager app which automatically selects a beautiful image from https://unsplash.it and sets it as the background of your website.

The images can be blurred or not, and made grayscale or not, and automatically adjust to the dimensions of the browser.

Additionally, you have the option of waiting to show the page until the background image has loaded.
